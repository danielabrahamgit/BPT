## Hardware and Schematic:
TODO - Include detailed schematic of the entire setup.

## Using the Code
The `rf_gen/rg_gen.ino` file is responsible for interfacing with the ADF4351 board. Assuming the hardware is wired up correctly, you will need to run the code onto the Arduino and then open up the serial monitor. This can be done be navigating to **Tools->Serial Monitor** in the Arduino IDE.  

Once the code is uploaded you can use the user interface via the *Serial Monitor*. Here are a few examples
